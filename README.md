### Mortgage calculator
I've created a mortgage calculator where the point of the calculator is to present the monthly payback based on 
total loan, interest and x years payback time. 
The calculator does not take into account anything but the interest. 

I chose not to clear the inputs as you often might want to compare values/results. 
Based on that, I iterated on the mvp and added the possibility to "compare" by letting the container present 5 results. 

I purposly did not spend any time on styling/css.
